Spark Components for etl-

   - This framework consists of three modules
            1. Common
                - common functionalities for  spark operations
                - Generic way of running the extract, transform and load methods

            2. Exchangerateproducer -
                   Extract -
                        * connect with openexchangerates and get conversion rate as json
                        * store the raw json
                        * Example output - FinancialReport/e2e/src/main/resources/e2eOutput/openexchangerates/raw/ExchangeRate
                   Transform -
                        * Process the raw json to get the required value
                        * convert the data into spark view
                   Load -
                        *Load the processed data into file system as orc file
                        * Example output - FinancialReport/e2e/src/main/resources/e2eOutput/processed/ExchangeRate

            2. report -
                    Extract -
                        * Extracts the raw report and processed conversion rate data
                        Example Input -
                          Rawreport - FinancialReport/e2e/src/main/resources/e2eOutput/financialreport
                          conversiondata -FinancialReport/e2e/src/main/resources/e2eOutput/processed/ExchangeRate

                    Transform -
                         * transform the raw report to convert the currency.
                    Load -
                         * write the final output
                         * Exampleoutput -FinancialReport/e2e/src/main/resources/e2eOutput/report/financeReport

Highlights
------------
        - Exchangerateproducer and report are individual components

        - This components can be deployed with cron scheduling

        - This components can be deployed as Aws Lambda

        - This framework is configuration based. The input, source system and output can be configurable

        - New ETL components can be easily developed and integrated using this framework
        
        - Monitoring component is not available in this code. We can develop a sms/email notification system by querying the file system on daily basis
